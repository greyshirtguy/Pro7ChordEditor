# Notes on the Mac app

For the next session, which will remember nothing of the ones before: what was decided
on the way and why, what was found out about ProPresenter on the Mac, and what is left
rough. Read it after `AGENTS.md` and `spec/11-plan.md`. Add to it at the end of every
milestone; put right what has become untrue.

## Where things stand

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M0** Setting up | Done, 2026-10-10 | The package and its three layers, empty; the generated reader; nine tests; the Xcode project and an app with one window; the workflow |
| **M1** The rules | Next | |

## What the maintainer decided, 2026-10-10

1. **Both apps read files with code generated from `proto/autogen-proto`**, the set
   taken from ProPresenter itself, not `proto/proto` as the pages first said. The
   pages were put right the same day, in commits made beside this work
   (`spec/01-file-format.md` has the whole of it).
2. **"Everything else as it came" is said of the message, not of the bytes.** The
   maintainer's words: the rule "is about not disturbing/breaking ProPresenter's
   parsing of these protocol buffer files". `Core/Sources/ProFormat/ProFormat.swift`
   has the long of it.
3. **There is no `PathSettings.proPaths` on the Mac.** ProPresenter has workspaces,
   each with a folder of its own. The app is to show the workspaces it finds and let
   one be picked; anything else is opened with Choose Folder. How ProPresenter records
   them is to be found out at M3, by reading only (`spec/06-library.md`, rule 3).
4. **macOS 15 and 26** are "the newest macOS and the one before it".
5. **The ignore rules are one file for each app.** The Visual Studio list that was at
   the top of the repository would have left out any folder under `mac/` named
   `Packages`, `Debug` or `Backup…`. It is now `windows/.gitignore`; `mac/.gitignore`
   is the Mac's; the one at the top has only what is true of both.
6. **The maintainer has real songs on this Mac** that may be read, and checked
   against as copies outside the repository: some from Multitracks as they came, some
   changed by the old Windows editor. Ask where. Nothing of them comes into the
   repository (`AGENTS.md`, "The person's files").

## How it is laid out, and why

```
mac/
  Pro7ChordEditor.xcodeproj   the app target, and nothing else
  App/                        the app: SwiftUI, thin
  Core/                       one Swift package: everything with no window in it
    Sources/ChordRules/         the rules (M1)                  no protobuf, no AppKit
    Sources/ProFormat/          the generated reader of a .pro  nothing by hand
    Sources/Song/               the song, the copies, the checks (M2 on)
    Tests/TestData/             how tests find testdata/
    Tests/ChordRulesTests/      held to testdata/vectors
    Tests/SongTests/            held to testdata/files
    generate-proto.sh           what made Sources/ProFormat/Generated
```

- **One package, three libraries**, not three packages: one `swift test`, one
  `Package.resolved`, and a target still cannot import what it does not name.
- **The generated code is kept in the repository.** swift-protobuf's build plug-in
  only takes `.proto` files inside the package, and these are in a submodule outside
  it. Kept, the package builds from a clone with no submodule and no `protoc`.
  `Generated/MadeFrom.swift` says what it was made from. **Run
  `mac/Core/generate-proto.sh` again whenever the `proto/` submodule is moved on**;
  nothing checks that for you (see "Left rough").
- **Only what a presentation needs is generated**: `presentation.proto` and what it
  imports, 32 files of the 148. For another kind of file, add its `.proto` to `ROOTS`
  in the script.
- **Tests find `testdata/` by walking up from their own source file.** A package
  cannot take resources from outside itself.
- **The Xcode project was written by hand**, not made by a tool, so that there is no
  tool to depend on. Its `App` folder is one that follows the disk (a "synchronized"
  folder, Xcode 16 and later): a file added to `mac/App` is in the app without the
  project being touched. `Info.plist` is named in the project as not a resource.
- **The package is in the project as a folder**, not as a package the project refers
  to. Both build the app. Only the first lets the scheme run the package's tests
  (Command+U in Xcode): with a reference, `xcodebuild test` answered "There are no
  test bundles available to test".
- **The app target** is Swift 6, with the main actor as the default for its own code,
  as Xcode 26 sets a new app up. The package is plain Swift 6.
- **`com.greyshirtguy.Pro7ChordEditor`** is the app's bundle identifier. It is my
  choice, from the GitHub name, and is the maintainer's to change. Better changed
  before M3 than after: macOS keeps what the person has allowed the app, and the
  app's settings, under it.
- **The app is signed "to run locally"** (ad hoc), which needs no account. The
  hardened runtime is switched on in the project and Xcode leaves it off for an ad hoc
  signature, saying so in the build log; it comes on by itself when the app is signed
  with a Developer ID at M10.

## What was found out

- **A file read and written back unchanged is the same, byte for byte**, in every
  file tried: the nine of `testdata/files`, and copies of 22 real songs of the
  maintainer's (14 from Multitracks; last written by ProPresenter 7.8.0, 7.9.2,
  7.13.0, 7.16.2, 17.1.0, 18.1.0, 19.0.0 and 20.0.1 on the Mac and 7.14.0 on Windows;
  1,299 chords among them). This was a check made once, by hand, on copies in a
  temporary folder, with a throwaway program on `ProFormat`; it is not a test and is
  not relied on, since the rule is about the message (above). But it means that a
  change of chords should change the bytes of the chords and nothing else, which is
  worth a test at M2 on `testdata/files`.
- **`proto/autogen-proto` knows every field in those 22 files.** `protoc --decode`
  shows none without a name. Through the older `proto/proto` there are 123 without a
  name, in 4 of the files. That is the difference the maintainer's first decision
  makes: nothing is lost either way, but with the newer set there is nothing in
  those files the app is blind to.
- **The descriptions are of ProPresenter 21.4; ProPresenter 22 is installed on this
  Mac.** No file tried was written by 22. When the submodule has 22's, move it on and
  generate again.
- **ProPresenter's bundle identifier is `com.renewedvision.propresenter`**, in every
  version installed here (7.9.2, 7.14.1, 18.3, 21.3, 22). Now in `spec/06`, rule 17.
- **ProPresenter's own settings** are in
  `~/Library/Application Support/RenewedVision/ProPresenter/`. Seen there, by name
  only: `Workspaces/workspace-v1.sqlite3` and a `UserWorkspaces` folder. Not opened
  yet: that is M3's.
- **The test files say they were written by ProPresenter 7.16.2 on no platform**
  (`application_info`): Simple Presenter wrote them. A file ProPresenter wrote says
  `macos` or `windows`.
- **`protoc` warns "Import customOptions.proto is unused"** once for nearly every
  file when the script runs. It is true and harmless: the descriptions are taken from
  ProPresenter by a program, and it leaves those lines in.
- **Swift 6.1 at least** is needed: the generated code marks its types `nonisolated`.
  So Xcode 16.3 or later; the workflow uses GitHub's `macos-26`.
- **The workflow passes on GitHub's Mac** (first run, 2026-10-10, on `macos-26`, under
  two minutes): the tests, and the app built and signed to run locally, from a clone
  with no submodule and nothing installed. That was the last of M0's "done when".
- **Pushing is over SSH.** The key on this Mac is one GitHub knows. Over https, the
  token in the keychain may not change `.github/workflows`, and a push that touches a
  workflow is refused. `gh` is installed and not signed in; it is not needed to push,
  and the runs of a public repository can be read without it.

## Left rough, and what to ask

- **No test draws a picture yet.** There is nothing to draw but a line of text. Where
  the views and their picture tests are to live is to be settled at M3, when there is
  a first real view. My proposal: a fourth library in `Core` for the views (SwiftUI
  and AppKit, no `@main`), so that `swift test` draws them and the Xcode target stays
  an `App` struct and an `Info.plist`. It bends "the app is a thin third thing" only
  by making it thinner. The maintainer's to say.
- **Nothing checks that `Generated/` matches the submodule.** The workflow could
  generate again and compare, but GitHub's Mac would then need the same `protoc` and
  `protoc-gen-swift` as made it, to the version. Not worth it yet.
- **A presentation that ProPresenter itself made, of words anyone may use**, is asked
  of the maintainer before M9 by the plan. It is wanted before M2: saving is proved
  there, and every test file so far was written by Simple Presenter. A few slides of
  Amazing Grace typed into ProPresenter would do.
- **From M3 on**, macOS may ask again for leave to read Documents each time the app
  is rebuilt, since an ad hoc signature is a new one each build. **A guess**, not yet
  seen. If it does, signing with the maintainer's own Apple Development certificate
  stops it.
