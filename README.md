# Pro7ChordEditor

Yep, it does what is says on the box!
This is a very simple/crude chord editor (that runs on Windows) for Pro7.
(Mac version is on the TODO list)


You can add/edit chords to the lyrics of a song by typing them in [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/) format - where chords are inline text inside square brackets.

This is not yet finished/ready to use (but I'm getting close!)

Usual disclaimers apply - this is an *unsupported* 3rd party app. Use at your own risk!.
