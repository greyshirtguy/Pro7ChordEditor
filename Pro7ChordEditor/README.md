# Pro7ChordEditor

Yep, this is what is says on the box - A very simple/crude chord editor for Pro7 that allows you to add/edit chords in any Pro7 song!
This is not yet finished/ready to use (but getting close!)

Usual disclaimers apply! This is an *unsupported* 3rd party app. Use at your own risk!
hmmm
